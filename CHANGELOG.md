# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Raster extension support ([#364](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/issues/364))
- solar_illumination field in eo extension ([#356](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/issues/356))
- Added `Link.canonical` static method for creating links with "canonical" rel type ([#351](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/351))
- Added `RelType` enum containing common `rel` values ([#351](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/351))

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## [1.0.0-beta.2]

### Changed

- Split `DefaultStacIO`'s reading and writing into two methods to allow subclasses to use the default link resolution behavior ([#354](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/354))
- Increased test coverage for the pointcloud extension ([#352](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/352))

### Fixed

- Reading json without orjson ([#348](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/348))

### Removed

- Removed type information from docstrings, since it is redundant with function type
  annotations ([#342](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/342))

## [v1.0.0-beta.1]

### Added

- Added type annotations across the library ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))
- Added assets to collections ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))
- `item_assets` extension ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))
- `datacube` extension ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))
- Added specific errors: `ExtensionAlreadyExistsError`, `ExtensionTypeError`, and `RequiredPropertyMissing`; moved custom exceptions to `pystac.errors` ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))

### Fixed

- Validation checks in a few tests ([#346](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/346))

### Changed

- API change: The extension API changed significantly. See ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309)) for more details.
- API change: Refactored the global STAC_IO object to an instance-specific `StacIO` implementation. STAC_IO is deprecated and will be removed next release. ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))
- Asset.get_absolute_href returns None if no absolute href can be inferred (previously the relative href that was passed in was returned) ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))

### Removed

- Removed `properties` from Collections ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309))
- Removed `LinkMixin`, and implemented those methods on `STACObject` directly. STACObject was the only class using LinkMixin and this should not effect users ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309)
- Removed `single-file-stac` extension; this extension is being removed in favor of ItemCollection usage ([#309](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/309)

## [v0.5.6]

### Added

- HIERARCHICAL_LINKS array constant of all the types of hierarchical links (self is not included) ([#290](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/290))

### Fixed

- Fixed error when accessing the statistics attribute of the pointcloud extension when no statistics were defined ([#282](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/282))
- Fixed exception being thrown when calling set_self_href on items with assets that have relative hrefs ([#291](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/291))

### Changed

- Link behavior - link URLs can be either relative or absolute. Hierarchical (e.g., parent, child) links are made relative or absolute based on the value of the root catalog's `catalog_type` field ([#290](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/290))
- Internal self hrefs are set automatically when adding Items or Children to an existing catalog. This removes the need to call `normalize_hrefs` or manual setting of the hrefs for newly added STAC objects ([#294](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/294))
- Catalog.generate_subcatalogs is an order of magnitude faster ([#295](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/295))

- Removed LinkType class and the `link_type` field from links ([#290](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/290))

## [v0.5.5]

### Added

- Added support for STAC file extension ([#270](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/270))

### Fixed

- Fix handling of optional properties when using apply on view extension ([#259](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/259))
- Fixed issue with setting None into projection extension fields that are not required breaking validation ([#269](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/269))

### Changed

- Subclass relevant classes from `enum.Enum`. This allows iterating over the class' contents. The `__str__` method is overwritten so this should not break backwards compatibility. ([#261](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/261))
- Extract method to correctly handle setting properties in Item/Asset for ItemExtensions ([#272](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/272))

## [v0.5.4]

### Added

- SAT Extension ([#236](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/236))

### Fixed

- Fix unexpected behaviour of `generate_subcatalogs` ([#241](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/241))
- Get eo bands defined in assets only ([#243](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/243))
- Collection TemporalExtent can be open ended ([#247](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/247))
- Make asset HREFs relative or absolute based on CatalogType during save ([#251](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/251))

- Added the capability to more flexibly organize STACs using `normalize_hrefs` ([#219](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/219))
- Added a 'generate_subcatalogs' to Catalog to allow for subcatalogs to be created by using item properties via a template string ([#219](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/219))
- Added 'from_items' method to Extent ([#223](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/pull/223))

## [v0.4.0]

The two major changes for this release are:
- Upgrade to STAC 0.9.0
- Refactor the extensions API to accommodate items that implement multiple extensions (e.g. `eo` and `view`)

See the [stac-spec 0.9.0 changelog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/v0.9.0/CHANGELOG.md) and issue [#65](https://github.com/azavea/pystac/issues/65) for more information.

### API Changes

These are the major API changes that will have to be accounted for when upgrading PySTAC:

#### Extensions are wrappers around Catalogs, Collection and Items, and no longer inherit.

This change affects the two extensions that were implemented for Item - `EOItem` and `LabelItem`
have become `EOItemExt` and `LabelItemExt`, and no longer inherit from Item.

This change was motivated by the 0.9 change that split some properties out from `eo` into
the `view` extension. If we kept an inheritance-based extension architecture, we would not
be able to account well for these new items that implemented both the `eo` and `view` extensions.

See the [Extensions section](https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/0.4/concepts.html#extensions) in the
documentation for more information on the new way to use extensions.

#### Extensions have moved to their own package:
- `pystac.label` -> `pystac.extensions.label`
- `pystac.eo` -> `pystac.extensions.eo`
- `pystac.single_file_stac` -> `pystac.extensions.single_file_stac`

### Added

- `pystac.read_file` as a convenience function for reading in a STACObject from a file at a URI which delegates to `STACObject.from_file`.
- `pystac.read_file` as a convenience function for reading in a STACObject from a file at a URI.
- Added support for the [view](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/view) extension.
- Added support for the [commons](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/v0.9.0/extensions/commons) extension.

### Changed
- Migrated CI workflows from Travis CI to GitHub Actions [#108](https://github.com/azavea/pystac/pull/108)
- Dropped support for Python 3.5 [#108](https://github.com/azavea/pystac/pull/108)

- Extension classes for label, eo and single-file-stac were moved to the `pystac.extensions` package.
- the eo and label extensions changed from being a subclass of Item to wrapping items. __Note__: This is a major change in the API for dealing with extensions. See the note below for more information.
- Renamed the class that enumerates extension names from `Extension` to `Extensions`
- Asset properties always return a dict instead of being None for Assets that have non-core properties.
- The `Band` constructor in the EO extension changed to taking a dict. To create a band from property values,
use `Band.create`
