Dependencies
=============

As a foundational component of the Python STAC ecosystem used in a number of downstream
libraries, PySTAC aims to minimize its dependencies. As a result, the only dependency
for the basic PySTAC library is `python-dateutil
<https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.

PySTAC also has the following extras, which can be optionally installed to provide
additional functionality:

* ``validation``

  Installs the additional `jsonschema
  <https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ dependency. When this
  dependency is installed, the :ref:`validation methods <validation_concepts>` may be
  used to validate STAC objects against the appropriate JSON schemas.

  To install:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install pystac[validation]

* ``orjson``

  Installs the additional `orjson <https://github.com/ijl/orjson>`__ dependency. When
  this dependency is installed, `orjson` will be used as the default JSON
  serialization/deserialization for all operations in PySTAC.

  To install:

  .. code-block:: bash

      pip install pystac[orjson]
