Contributing
============

A list of issues and ongoing work is available on the PySTAC `issues page
<https://github.com/azavea/pystac/issues>`_. If you want to contribute code, the best
way is to coordinate with the core developers via an issue or pull request conversation.

Development installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fork PySTAC into your GitHub account. Then, clone the repo and install it locally with
pip as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_user_name/pystac.git
    $ cd  pystac
    $ pip install -e .

Testing
^^^^^^^
PySTAC runs tests using ``unittest``. You can find unit tests in the ``tests/``
directory.

Run a single test with:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m unittest tests/test_catalog.py

or an entire folder using:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m unittest discover -v -s tests/

or the entire project using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./scripts/test

More details on using ``unittest`` are `here
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_.

Code quality checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PySTAC uses `flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ and`black
<https://github.com/psf/black>`_ for code formatting and style checks.

To run the flake8 style checks:

.. code-block:: bash

    > flake8 pystac tests

To format code:

.. code-block:: bash

    > ./scripts/format

We also use `doc8 <https://github.com/pycqa/doc8>`__ for style checking on RST files in
the docs.

To check doc formatting:

.. code-block:: bash

    > doc8 docs

You can also run the ``./scripts/test`` script to run unit tests, check code style with
``flake8`` and ``black``, and check type annotations using ``mypy`` and ``pyright``.

CHANGELOG
^^^^^^^^^

PySTAC maintains a `changelog  <https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_
to track changes between releases. All PRs should make a changelog entry unless
the change is trivial (e.g. fixing typos) or is entirely invisible to users who may
be upgrading versions (e.g. an improvement to the CI system).

For changelog entries, please link to the PR of that change. This needs to happen in a
few steps:

- Make a PR to PySTAC with your changes
- Record the link to the PR
- Push an additional commit to your branch with the changelog entry with the link to the
  PR.

For more information on changelogs and how to write a good entry, see `keep a changelog
<https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`_.
